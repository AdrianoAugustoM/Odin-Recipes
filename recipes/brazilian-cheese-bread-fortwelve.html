    <p>These yummy gluten/wheat free breads are good for those with Celiac disease or gluten intolerance.
        These are good either served plain, or with marinara sauce. For more variety, try adding a variety of herb seasonings, such as Italian seasoning or try substituting other cheeses for the Parmesan.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk or soy milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅔ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil, water, milk, and salt into a large saucepan, and place over high heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, remove from heat immediately, and stir in tapioca flour and garlic until smooth. Set aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the cheese and egg into the tapioca mixture until well combined, the mixture will be chunky like cottage cheese. Drop rounded, 1/4 cup-sized balls of the mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
